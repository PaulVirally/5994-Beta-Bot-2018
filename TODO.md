* Make the joystick input smoothing an input that can be changed via the SmartDashboard
* Add a notification if something is being recorded on the SmartDashboard
* Add the following commands:
    * preciseDrive
    * playBack
* Make reverseDrive, preciseDrive, etc. toggles on the SmartDashboard as opposed to buttons you have to hold (so that it could be like a button you press once to toggle on and then turn it off but pressing that button again)
